# NERP

NERP is a custom render pipeline for unity.

It's goal is to implement Stencil Based Portal Rendering, identical to the one found in Portal.
Stencil based rendering is generally more efficient than the texture based implementations found across many tutorials.
This method uses less memory and resources.
